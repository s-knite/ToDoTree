# 🌳 Tree To-Do List

A highly visual, infinite-canvas task manager that lets you break down complex goals into infinite subtasks. Instead of a rigid top-down list, tasks are mapped out as a tree, allowing you to visually grasp your project's scope, dependencies, and progress at a glance.

## ✨ Features

* **Infinite Canvas Engine:** Pan and zoom around your task tree freely.
* **Hierarchical Task Mapping:** Break any task down into child subtasks. Branches are automatically color-coded for visual clarity.
* **Smart Progress Tracking:** Completing a subtask automatically updates the percentage progress bar of its parent. 
* **Rich Node Data:** Every task node supports a title, description, due date, and multiple clickable URL links.
* **Auto-Save & Local Storage:** Everything is saved to your browser's local storage instantly. You will never lose your place if you accidentally refresh.
* **Import / Export:** Download your entire tree as a `.json` backup and restore it on any other device.
* **Mobile Optimized:** Fully responsive with custom touch-targets, mobile-specific modals, and gesture support for phones and tablets.
* **Keyboard Shortcuts:** Power-user shortcuts for rapid task creation, navigation, and canvas centering.
